## Objective:
This project aims to develop a fully functional Twitter clone using React.js, providing an immersive and dynamic social media experience that replicates Twitter's core features. Users will be able to create and manage profiles, post tweets, interact through likes and comments, and stay connected with real-time updates. Developed as a student project, the Twitter clone offers hands-on experience in building complex, real-time web applications using modern technologies, tackling challenges like user authentication, real-time data synchronization, responsive design, and scalability. With a sleek and intuitive interface, the clone will enable users to seamlessly express themselves, share thoughts, engage with a vibrant online community, participate in discussions, explore trending topics, and connect effortlessly.
